# 403-bypasser-burp-extention
Lightweight Jython Burp extension that spins up a self-contained Swing UI inside Extender to test path &amp; header payloads against 403 responses, no Burp Pro active scanner required. Fast to drop in, safe-by-default (scope checks + rate limiting), and built with Burp helpers so itâ€™s robust, not hacky.
